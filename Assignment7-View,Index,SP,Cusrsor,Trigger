--Views Index Stored Procedures Triggers and Cursors Assignment
--Please write SQL queries/commands/explanation for the following and give the
--suggested output for each query:

--1. What are Views? What are the advantages of using views?
--Ans
--Views are are virtual table. They do not really store any data. 
--They only contain references of column from the main table as per the select clause
--Advantages:
--	1. Reduce apparent database complexity
--	2. Prevent sensitive columns from being selected
--	3. Optimise storage space
--	4. Speed query peformance
--Syntax:
	Create View View_name
	as 
	select statement

--2. Create a View for any existing table you have.

select * from customer
--Creating View on customer
Create View VW_customer as
select CID,Order_id,Price_paid
from customer
where LOCATION in ('Bangalore','Hyderabad')

select * from VW_customer


--3. Is it possible to make changes in the view? If yes the explain with the help of example
--how changes can be made.
--Ans
--Yes it is possible to alter views with ALTER command.
--It can also be modified from object explores
--e.g
Alter View VW_customer
as
select CID,Order_id,Location,Price_paid
from customer
where LOCATION in ('Bangalore','Hyderabad','Pune')

select * from VW_customer

--4. Can we drop the view? If yes, then how?
--Yes we can also drop view as we drop any object in SQL

Drop view VW_customer


--5. What are Indexes? What are the advantages of using Indexes? When by default indexes
--are created?
--Ans
--Indexes are database objects which can not be seen by users. 
--It acts Just like an index of book to retrieve data data faster.
--It helps in organising relevent data structure to minimize data comparison
--It helps in improve Query Performance
--By default indexes are created on Primary Key and Unique constarints columns
--In Primary Key Clustered Index are created by default and 
--in Unique key constarint Non Clustered Index are craeted by default

--Note: To update a table with indexes takes more time than non indexed table becozbindex also nedds to be updated
--		So avoid creating index on table which are subjected to frequent change or update

--6. Discuss Different Types of indexes? When Clustered Indexes and Non Clustered Indexes
--can be used?
--Ans
--There are two type of Indexes
--1. Clustered Index
--2. NonClustered Index
--1. Clustered Index:
--	In clustered index, data in the table are physically sorted, 
--	means when new row is inserted, it physically goes to the place determined by index
--	Only one CI is allowed per table
--	It works on Binary Tree principle
--	By default created on Primary Key column
--  Clustered Index are used in following cases
--	Columns that contain a large number of distinct values.
--	Queries that return a range of values using operators such as BETWEEN, >, >=, <, and <=.
--	Columns that are accessed sequentially.
--	Queries that return large result sets.
--	Columns that are frequently accessed by queries involving join or GROUP BY clauses; typically these are foreign key columns. 
--  Clustered Index should be avoided in following cases
--	columns which undergo changes frequently
--	Columns with wide keys

--2.Non Clustered Index
--	In non clustered index, data values are not physically sorted but logically sorted and 
--	Index plays the role of  “pointer to row”, allowing faster access to row that is requested.  
--	It is just like the index of a book. It contains data sorted so that it’s easy to find, 
--	then once found, it points back to the actual page that contains the data.
--	More than 1 NON CI are allowed (max 255)
--  Syntax:
--    CREATE    CLUSTERED  INDEX  index_name
--	ON  table_name  (Column_name)

--  Where to use Non CI
--	Columns that contain a large number of distinct values, such as a combination of last name and first name
--	Queries that do not return large result sets.
--	Columns frequently involved in search conditions of a query (WHERE clause) that return exact matches.
--	Decision-support-system applications for which joins and grouping are frequently required.
--	Covering all columns from one table in a given query
--  Syntax:
--    CREATE    [ NONCLUSTERED ]  INDEX  index_name
--	ON  table_name  (Column_name)
-----------------------------------------Q6 Ends-------------------------------------------------------

--7. What are Stored Procedures (SPs) and why do we use it?
--Ans
--A stored Procedures is set of SQL statements with an assigned name to perform certain task,
--which can be saved in the database and  can be used again and  again.
--If any SQL queries is required to write over and over again, then it can be saved as 
--stored procedure and then call it to execute it.
--Syntax:
--SP SYNTAX:    
--	CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
--	(@Variable_name1 datatype1, 
--		@Variable_name2 datatype2,…)
--	AS
--	BEGIN
--	DECLARE @variable3 datatype3
--	SET OF SQL STATEMENTS AND SCRIPTS
--	…
--	END


--8. How to invoke Stored Procedure (SP)? How we can see the code of any SP?
--Ans
--A stored procedure can be invoked by EXEC clause 
--syntax:
--EXEC USP_Name value1,value2,.....

--To see the code of any USP, sp_helptext is used
--syntax
--sp_helptext USP_name


--9. What are Triggers? Discuss three types of Triggers?
--Ans
--A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when an event occurs in the database server.
--Its a special kind of stored procedure stored and managed by DBMS
--There are three kind of triggers
--	1. DDL trigger: fire on response to some changes in structure of database such as create,alter,drop
--	2.DML Trigger: fire on insert, update and delete
--		Note: No trigger for Select clause
--	3. Logon Trigger: fire in response of logon events
--		event is raises when user session is established with instance sql server

--10. When After/For and Instead of Triggers are used?
--Ans
--After/For Triggers are used when we need to fire the trigger after the execution of some SQL query.	
--Means it trigger after succesfull execution of DDL or DML command

--Instead of triggers fire before the execution of an action query that can only be DML statements like 
--Insert, Update and Delete but after the execution of that query. The table data will not be affected, 
--in other words if you want to insert or update the data of the table then you need to write it in the 
--trigger using "inserted" or "deleted" virtual tables

--11. What are cursors? When we can use cursors? When cursors should not be used?
--ANS
--A SQL cursor is a database object which is used to retrieve data from a result set one row at a time. 
--A SQL cursor is used when the data needs to be updated row by row.

--In relational databases, operations are made on a set of rows. For example, a SELECT statement returns 
--a set of rows which is called a result set. Sometimes the application logic needs to work with one row at 
--a time rather than the entire result set at once. This can be done using cursors.
--In programming, we use a loop like FOR or WHILE to iterate through one item at a time, 
--the cursor follows the same approach and might be preferred because it follows the same logic.

--CURSOR LIMITATIONS
--A cursor is a memory resident set of pointers -- meaning it occupies memory from your system that may be available for other processes.
--Cursors can be faster than a while loop but they do have more overhead.
--Another factor affecting cursor speed is the number of rows and columns brought into the cursor. 
--Time how long it takes to open your cursor and fetch statements.
--Too many columns being dragged around in memory, which are never referenced in the subsequent cursor operations, can slow things down.
--The cursors are slower because they update tables row by row.

--Therefore it should be avoided 
--	where multiple database activities are in process simulatneously
--	when theres is large dat set


--Synntax:
--	DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR
--	[ LOCAL | GLOBAL ]
--	[ FORWARD_ONLY | SCROLL ]
--	[ STATIC | KEYSET | DYNAMIC | FAST_FORWARD ]
--	[ READ_ONLY | SCROLL_LOCKS | OPTIMISTIC ]
--	[ TYPE_WARNING ]
--	FOR select_statement
--	[ FOR UPDATE [ OF column_name [ ,...n ] ] ]


--12. Create Clustered Index and Non-Clustered Index on any table.
select * from cust_info
--Creating CI on custid if cust_info
Create Clustered Index CI_CustInfo_custid
on cust_info(custid)

Drop Index CI_CustInfo_custid on  cust_info

Create Clustered Index CI_CustInfo_orderid
on cust_info(orderid)

--Creating Non Clustered Index on cust info
Create NONCLUSTERED Index NCI_custinfo_custid
on cust_info(custid)

Create Index NCI_custinfo_cid
on cust_info(cid)



--13. Create a Calculator for arithmetic operations by creating a Stored Procedure for it.
--Solution
create procedure usp_calculator(@n1 float, @op varchar(2), @n2 float)
as
begin
declare @result float
if(@op = '+')
	begin
	set @result=@n1+@n2
	print (cast (@n1 as varchar(10))+' '+@op+' ' + cast (@n2 as varchar(10)) + ' = '+cast (@result as varchar(10)))
	end
else if(@op = '-')
	begin
	set @result=@n1-@n2
	print (cast (@n1 as varchar(10))+' '+@op+' ' + cast (@n2 as varchar(10)) + ' = '+cast (@result as varchar(10)))
	end
else if(@op = '*')
	begin
	set @result=@n1*@n2
	print (cast (@n1 as varchar(10))+' '+@op+' ' + cast (@n2 as varchar(10)) + ' = '+cast (@result as varchar(10)))
	end
else if(@op = '/')
	begin
	set @result=@n1/@n2
	print (cast (@n1 as varchar(10))+' '+@op+' ' + cast (@n2 as varchar(10)) + ' = '+cast (@result as varchar(10)))
	end
else 
	begin
	print 'Enter Valid Operator'
	end
END

EXEC usp_calculator 20,'+',10
EXEC usp_calculator 20,'-',10
EXEC usp_calculator 20,'*',10
EXEC usp_calculator 20,'/',10
EXEC usp_calculator 20,'%',10


--14. Create a Stored Procedure to create email ids by using first name dot first 3 characters
--of last name @nikhilanalytics.com. For eg. if first name is manoj and last name is kumar
--then email id generated will be manoj.kum@nikhilanalytics.com. First name, last name
--and email id every time should be stored in Email_contact Table.
--Solution
create table Email_contact(
First_name varchar(15) not null, Last_name varchar(15) not null, Mail_ID varchar(30) not null)

alter table Email_contact
alter column Mail_ID varchar(40) not null

Create Procedure usp_mail_id_generator (@fn varchar(15), @ln varchar(15))
as
begin
declare @result  varchar(40)
set @result = CONCAT(@fn,'.',left(@ln,3),'@nikhilanalytics.com')

insert into Email_contact
values(@fn,@ln,@result)

print 'First Name: ' + @fn
print 'Last Name: '+@ln
print 'Mail Id: ' + @result

END

exec usp_mail_id_generator 'Manoj', 'Kumar'

select *  from Email_contact

--15. Create Table Emp_test with columns emp_id int, ename Varchar(20) , salary float.
--Create an After Insert Trigger on Emp_test. Trigger should fire a code to insert Emp_id,
--Ename, Salary , Audit_Action ,Timestamp to Emp_Audit table.

--Creating Tables
create table emp_test(
	emp_id varchar(10) not null,
	cname varchar(20) not null,
	salary float not null)

---TRIGGER STARTS HERE
Create Trigger TRG_emptest_after_insert
on emp_test
after insert 
as
Declare @eid varchar(10), @name varchar(20), @sal float, @audit varchar(100)--, @user varchar(50)

Select @eid  = i.emp_id from inserted as i
Select @name  = i.cname from inserted as i
Select @sal  = i.salary from inserted as i
Select @audit = 'User has Logged in information'+suser_name()+' at '+cast(getdate() as varchar(30))

Insert into emp_audit(emp_id,cname,salary,user_name,audit_action,time_stamp)
Select @eid, @name, @sal, SUSER_NAME(), @audit, getdate()

---TRIGGER ENDS HERE

Insert into emp_test
select 'AE2011','Ajay Kumar',49500

Insert into emp_test
select 'AE2012','Amit Kumar',48500

--16. Create an Instead of Triggers on any table. If some one tries to insert any record in the
--table, trigger should fire a code to which will print “You are not allowed to insert
--records”.
--Sol
select * from customer

--trigger starts here
create trigger trg_customer_insteadof_insert
on customer
instead of insert 
as 
print 'YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO FURTHER INSERT RECORDS IN CUSTOMER TABLE'
--tigger ends

insert into customer
select 'AE201254', 'Vija', 'BLR', 12546,GETDATE(), 35623


--17. Update all the rows of your Salary Table on the basis of Designation using Cursors.
--If Designation is CEO salary should increase to 5%, If Designation is President salary
--should increase to 7%, If Designation is VP salary should increase to 9%, If Designation is
--SSE salary should increase to 10%, If Designation is Business Analyst salary should
--increase to 15% for rest salary should increase to 20%.

select * from salary_info

----cursor starts here
declare CUR_SAL cursor
For select emp_id , designation from salary_info
declare @id varchar(10), @desig varchar(30)

open Cur_sal

fetch next from cur_sal into @id, @desig

while(@@FETCH_STATUS = 0)
	Begin
	If (@desig = 'CEO')
